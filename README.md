# Automatic Case Simulator
This is an Automated Case Simulator written in Python, and it is my first Python project. The project aims to simulate case handling processes through automated logic in code. During development, I relied on ChatGPT for assistance in solving programming challenges and optimizing the code. Welcome to check it out, provide feedback, or contribute to improvements!
